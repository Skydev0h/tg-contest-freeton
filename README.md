# Telegram contest to Free TON
Telegram blockchain contest smart contracts integrated into Free TON.

---

This is a rewrite of [Conditional transfer smart contract](https://github.com/Skydev0h/ton-freestyle/blob/master/doc/Project1.md) for the [FreeTON Contest #14: Reward Distribution Contest: Telegram/TON Contests Winners](https://gov.freeton.org/proposal?proposalAddress=0:1f417bdd2177883234c9a2cb0370851b03bf10d814ce0b49aedcd1e34c8a413f) ([FreeTON Forum discussion](https://forum.freeton.org/t/1455)).

The original contract was written in FunC and was deployed using Fift scripts.

The rewritten contract is written in Solidity and is deployed using TON OS tools.

(In future deployment using DeBots and TON OS SDK is planned when they will be ready)
